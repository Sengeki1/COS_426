# Computer Graphics Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my Computer Graphics assignment, which includes two main components:

1. **Paint Application** - A simple painting tool that allows users to create digital drawings.
2. **Image Processing** - Various image manipulation techniques applied to enhance and modify images.

Each section has its own `README.md` file detailing the implementation and features.

## Contents

### Paint Application
- Implements basic drawing functionalities (brush, eraser, color selection, etc.).
- Supports different brush sizes and shapes.

### Image Processing
- Includes filters such as grayscale, blur, and edge detection.
- Allows image transformations like rotation and scaling.
- Uses different algorithms for processing images.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the respective project folder.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each `README.md` and pdf file.
3. Run the program as described.
